## require()

1. Let's us to **load modules** that come bundled with node JS
    like the HTTP module, which lets us make a web server and 
    the FS module, which lets us access the file system for our machine.
2. Use require() to **load in 3rd party libraries**, like Express and sequelize,
    which are going to let us write less code.
3. We also gonna use require() to **require our own files**!
